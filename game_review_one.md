# Game Review for Dragon Warrior IV (Dragon Quest IV)

## Details

### Game Title
Dragon Warrior IV: Chapters of the Chosen (aka Dragon Quest IV in Japan) for the NES

### Rating
I rate my games with a star rating 1-5, 1 being garbage and 5 being super fun and replayable. I rate this game a 5. I really have fun with this game and find myself playing it over and over. The individual stories of the characters creates an attachment to each one and getting a feel for each character and their own journey/struggles before going on the search for the "Chosen One" makes the game so much broader.

There is Android/iOS remake that does add additional functionality with the AI system and adds a new chapter to extend the game.

## Summary
This game is about a set of characters searching for the "Chosen One" who will save the world from destruction. A master creature is resurrecting and monsters are running rampant. Their is a prophecy that states the Chosen One will be the one who can stop the evil.

The game is broken up into 5 chapters, each with their own characters and storyline, eventually all gathering together in the final chapter to help the chosen one. For example, in Chapter 1, you play as a soldier named Ragnar in the castle town of Burland. The king summons all his soldiers, including Ragner, whom you'll control, and states that he is being bombarded with requests from mothers in a nearby town of dissappearances of their children. It is your duty to figure out what is causing the children to dissappear and rescuing them. During your journey, you realize that the monsters are kidnapping children hoping to find the "Chosen One" and kill him, thus creating a new journey to find the chosen child of prophecy.

The gameplay is command based, you can press the A button to access the menu giving you options such as, talk, search, item, equip, etc. When outside of town you'll come across random monster encounters and will be given commands at the start of battle: fight, parry, item, run. Once you defeat the monsters, you'll be given gold and experience points. Gaining enough experience points will advance you up a level increasing your stats. Gold is accumlated to purchase stronger equipment in towns.

The game is open world, so you can transverse the world via walking and eventually by boat and blimp. This makes the game feel free to roam as well as extend your horizons. For a game this old, it has a lot of nice features and great engaging storyline.

## Final Thoughts
I like the individual chapters of the game as they create unique storylines and character development. You get to get an in-depth experience with each character and see how their stories eventually connect into the final chapter. Once you reach the final chapter, you have your hero search for the others creating a strong party to ultimately fight the master boss. 

What I did not like about the game is in the final chapter is the change to the combat system. Once you find any of the characters, they go into an AI mode, so you can only give your hero commands and the others will act on their own. You do have a new tactics option that helps you in controlling the AI characters somewhat. For example, selecting "offensive" will make the AI go all out and use whatever strongest attacks or spells are necessary, where as "defensive" will make your AI characters play more safely, focusing more on healing and supporting. Because of the AI, there are times where your other characters will use spells or commands that are completely useless to a monster/boss. After a few turns though, the AI will finally pick up on this and stop using something that doesn't work. 

There is an Android/iOS port of the game where there is extra chapter and also gives you the option to control your other characters if you so wish.
