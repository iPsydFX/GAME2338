# Game Review for Jumper Jon

## Details

### Game Title

### Rating
2/5 stars

## Summary
This game is a about a demon, named Jon, whom you play, that is set out to rescue his love, Jane. You are given 30 seconds to rescue Jane, by bumping into her, although nothing happens if you don't save her in 30 seconds, might be a game flaw. Jane will sometimes be locked up and you must find a key, or may be high up somewhere in the level and you have to climb to get her. The game features an ASCII level editor in which you can create you own levels or click random to get a random map. The game plays similar to Metroid in you have a spinning jump attack and can also wall jump.

## Final Thoughts
I like the fact you can create you own levels, as most of the levels in the game are VERY easy, although perhaps given you are supposed to have only 30 seconds, that might be why it's easy. What I didn't like about the game was the ASCII editor, it takes a while to get used to and most of the time its best just to create a random level. There isn't any type of tutorial to help you in the game in creating levels. Although, given its a quick little game, it is fun in some aspects, as I mentioned before, it plays similar to Metroid.
