### Rating
I give this game a 2.5/5 stars

## Summary
This game about a man named, Alex Mason, who gets captured and interrogated. Alex is an agent for America who gathers intel around the world. The setting is in the 1960's era. You play the game as Alex and play missions that he starts to remember to gather information and ultimately learn the story. 

The graphics are very realistic and aesthetically pleasing, however I had a hard time with the controls for the game. In my brief time playing, the game has different difficulties you can play on from Recruit (for people new to FPS) to Veteran (people highly experienced in FPS) The game mechanics is a bit weird for me. You use the left joystick to move in the direction you want and the right joystick to move the characters line of sight/focus. This is one of the things I don't like about FPS, in that you have to use both controls simultaniously to get the character to look like he's moving fluidly like a human.

The game itself plays out like a movie/story almost. There are missions you have to do, that aren't really missions persay, but it feels like you're playing through a script or scene. Because of this, there are certain things you cannot do or enemies you cannot kill until the enemy plays out his role. ie. Enemy with an RPG is getting ready to shoot at you, you can fire at him but he can't be hit, not until the scene plays out. This makes the game feel immersive, but at the same time is an annoyance as sometimes you can get lost and not know what you have to do until you die and get a hint.

The game also has different play modes, such as co-op (multi-player), solo, campaign (for the story), and Zombie Mode. Zombie mode lets you choose a map and you play to survive rounds of zombies coming after, each round getting more and more difficult. Killing the zombies nets you money which you can use to purchase weapons, unlock doors to expand the play field, etc. The purpose is to survive and get to the highest round you can before you ultimately die.

## Final Thoughts
What I hated the most is the controls. It was so hard to focus and aim. For me personally, I am not a fan of FPS games, so my review may be bias in that aspect, especially with the controls. What I did like about the game is the immersiveness of the game itself and getting to know your character, even though I only played for a short time, I did at least get a feel for the character. The other thing I liked was the Zombie mode feature, it was really fun.
