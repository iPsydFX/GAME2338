**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The game starts you off with playing tutorial matches, so it does go into great detail of how to play the game. How to move and use your actions.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Again being biased, but the in app purchases don't need to be in the game, I think its a money maker and I understand being a free game, I can see why and how they make their money. You can buy some neat skins for the characters. The other thing I think can go is the little slime thing in the bottom right corner of the main screen. Clicking on it provides you tips for the game, but I don't think it's very necessary for the gameplay.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game in my opinion does not feel balanced. I have played big name MOBAs, like League of Legends, and there are some things I feel are lacking in the champion creation. Typically the newer champs that come out are very over-powered, leaving the older champs completely obsolete. I played this game for over a year and in that time, I feel that everytime a new champ is released, its more powerful than the last, creating a "buy me" to win type of game. As far as audience, I believe this would fit more into the hardcore gamer. With the stratagies being utilized and the gameplay, to get better you have to invest hours into the game. The ranking system makes the game very competitive, thus attracting hardcore players even more to become better and reach the top tiers.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing is all dependant on the player and team in general. The game can be played safe thus being slow and long or players can be aggressive and play quick. It all dependant on the player's own individual play style and the overall team's playstyle. So to better answer the question, the timing is various and not set, therefore it is not balanced.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes, the game is a MOBA and the point of the game is to play as a team of 5 to take down the other team's base. The theme of the MOBA fits other big title MOBAs and the mechanics are about the same, except for some subtle differences.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes and no. I do still play this game as it is fun and playing with friends makes the game even better. The gameplay is fun and the champs and different roles you can play give you a variety of options to utilize in your match. What I dsilike is the way the publisher releases new champs and over-powers them to the point that the new champ becomes a staple to use and therefore creates a bit of unbalance gameplay.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Server problems was the most common problem. There are times there would be lag spikes thus creating lag times and reconnection issues. Some champs would have some bugs that would create unfair advantages to those who have exploited them, but the development team is quick to catch these and disable the champ until they can patch the bug.
