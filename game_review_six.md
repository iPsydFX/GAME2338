# Game Review for Jaws

## Details

### Game Title
Jaws https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(video_game) (game is not widely available due to its age)

### Rating
1/5

## Summary
This game is an adapation of the movie "Jaws." The game starts off with you sailing a ship from a port and as you sail around you will encounter sea creatures. Once you've "hit something" with the ship, the game turns into an underwater shooter type game. You control a diver and shoot random creatures. The creatures randomly drop stars (which give you points), shells (the games currency for buying more power), and crabs (collecting them makes your diver manuever faster). 

The object of the game is to kill Jaws. In order to do this you need to increase your power to make it easier to kill him. You can sail from port to another port and if you have enough shells, your power increases up to a max of 9. However if you get hit by any creatures underwater, you lose a life as well as all your shells and upgrades. 

Once you're strong enough you can sail into Jaws and fight him. After depleting his life bar, you pan to a first person view and have to lure Jaws in front of your boat and ram him to kill him. However, you have to hit him on the white of his stomach, failing to do so will do nothing to Jaws. After 3 attempts, if you fail the game will continue with you back on the boat and you'll have to shoot down Jaws health bar to get to the first person shot again.

## Final Thoughts
Honestly, there is nothing I like about this game. It is indeed a VERY hard and infuriating game given once you die, you lose everything. I did manage to beat the game and the ending was just terrible, there is no storyline, no tutorial, or any story at all, you are immediately thrown into the game once you hit start. I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.
