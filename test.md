* Requirements Covered:
  * Simulating movement to avoid obstacles
  * Simulating firing missles to destroy objects
* Test Description/Purpose:
  * The first test would be to automate movement, basically this would just create the automation to move up and down and see how many times, or how long, the ship can dodge before it collides into an object
  * The second test is stationary firing again to see how long the ship can last while firing stationary
  * The third test will be a combination of the ship moving up/down while firing
  * The fourth and last test will be dependant on pre-test variables
  * - If the object spawn is random, then the third test will be the biggest variable in random movement and firing
  * - If the object spawn is is patterned (pre-set), then the we will have the test automated to the way of the pattern
  * (of course the last test will again depend on the pre-test conditions, see below)
* Pre-Test Conditions:
  * Are the objects spawned randomly or is there a pattern?
  * How many bullets can I shoot at given time?
  * How many bullets can be on the screen at a given time?
  * Do I have unlimited missiles or is there a certain amount?
  * Are the objects different? ie. some indescructable, some bigger and may take more bullets to destroy, some that explode.
## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (âˆš) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Testing movement, will only have automated movement all the way up and then down, repeated, no firing| The ship moves up when up is pressed, down when down is pressed | |			
| 2 | Testing movement, being random, no firing| Random presses of up and down to make sure the ship is consistent with movement | |			
| 3 | Stationary shooting, will not move from spot, but will continously fire| Continous fire to make sure the missiles launch when button is pressed | |			
| 4 | Movement all the way up and then down, repeated, while firing| | |			
| 5 | Random movement, while firing| | |			
| 6 | IF a pattern exists in the spwning of objects, replicate the pattern for movement and firing| | |
