## Summary
This game is about a hero you play who is destined to save the land from turmoil. You're considered a cardmaster, who uses  stored items in cards as a means of attacks. You play a grid layout to move around the map. In each map there are monsters, towns, castles, and boss fights. The object of the game is to travel each of the lands and build your deck up to make it stronger. You yourself do not level up, but the cards increase your stats. You can win cards frmo battles or purchase them at towns with gold from battles.

The battle system works in a unique way, you battle with a deck and depending what card you play, you will take that action. For example, choosing a sword attack will make your character attack with a sword, spell cards will cast spells, and shields will defend. When I played, I used a full deck of attacks/spells to build a completely offensive deck fighting style. However, you can mix and match depending on your play style. Also your hand only consists of 4 cards, so its also a game of chance.

As you progress through the game, the cards get more and more powerful and shops will sell them for a much higher price. The game does involve a lot of level grinding, or in this case, gold farming to buy the best cards and place them in your deck. You are however restricted to a max number of 20 cards in the deck and 3-4 of the same card in your deck.

## Final Thoughts
As an avid card gamer and rpg player, this game combines the best of both worlds. I like the unique battle system involving cards as a means of battling, spell casting, etc. The game does involve chance as your hand is limited, so its like playing a card game, but in an RPG element.

What I didn't like about the game was the restriction of the stages, the grid system seems a little tied down as you can free wander like in most RPG games, in order to progress you have to clear that map. The other thing is the maps are completely the same as far as the grid like mapping for each stage, which tends to get a bit repetitive. The monsters on the map tend to have a repetitive nature and once you figure out cards to use on them, it becomes VERY easy.

A lot of negative feedback was given in this game by most reviews, especially with the poor translations, which I do agree with. That aside I think the game is interesting and fun and a good way to kill time on the go as the game is only available on mobile.
