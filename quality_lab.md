#Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

*I believe the game has great usability/reliability, there is no diffuculty curve and learning the controls was simple. The game played as well from start to finish without any issues/bugs that would deter the player from playing it.


#Final Fantasy VII

*Final Fantasy VII was a marvel for its time and for that I give it correctness. It was greatly anticipated and gave the player new mechanics. Everything functioned as it should and the quality of the game shows, even to this day still being listed as one of the best games of it's time.
