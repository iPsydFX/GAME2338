#Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

*I believe the game has great usability/reliability, there is no diffuculty curve in and learning the controls was simple. The game played as well from start to finish without any issues/bugs tht would deter the player from playing it. There was no difficulty in learning the mechanics of the game.
