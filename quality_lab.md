#Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

*I believe the game has great usability/reliability, there is no diffuculty curve and learning the controls was simple. The game played as well from start to finish without any issues/bugs that would deter the player from playing it.


#Final Fantasy VII

*Final Fantasy VII was a marvel for its time. It was greatly anticipated and gave the player new mechanics.
