#Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

*I believe the game has great usability/reliability, there is no diffuculty curve and learning the controls was simple. The game played as well from start to finish without any issues/bugs that would deter the player from playing it. As an old school game, there aren't many commands, so there is no confusion in using/learning the controls.


#Final Fantasy VII

*Final Fantasy VII was a marvel for its time and for that I give it correctness. It was greatly anticipated and gave the player new mechanics. Everything functioned as it should and the quality of the game shows, even to this day still being listed as one of the best games of it's time.

#Castlevania: Symphony of the Night

*Efficiency is what comes to mind when playing this game. For a Playstation 1 game of its time, its load times were pretty fast considered to most games. An exmaple of this is within levels of the castle. If you were to go into a section of the castle, you would confront a loading screen for a few seconds, however in that time, the entire section of that castle is loaded so any section of that level you go into is already loaded up and ready to go.
