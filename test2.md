| 2 |Hider spot, how often the hider is caught and how long it took|Knowing how many times that hiding place is searched and how long it took, expecting mixed results as seekers would adjust | |			
| 3 |Seeker, using elimination processes and finding where the best spot someone would hide, calulate the accuracy of your pick |Keeping track of how often a seeker will find a hider in a certain hiding spot on the first try, comparing the accurancy and ratio of found to not found, expecting mixed results as hiders may learn | |
