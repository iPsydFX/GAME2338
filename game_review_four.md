## Summary
This game is about you the player, who plays a mage to battle enemies. There isn't much or any of a storyline, just a simple RPG using dice as a means of attacks. You start off with your default equipment and as you progress in the game, you can buy or roll for bonus chests, to get better equipment. 

The game is setup to where you start on a stage, you can click on a block to jump to it and either fight a monster, roll for a bonus, roll for an item, or go to a shop to purchase equipment and heal up. The battles are found as a monster on the square you want to move to. When you enter battle, you roll two dice, whoever has the highest score wins and an attack is launched. However, with your equipped weapon (a book), you die rolls can also perform special attacks (ie. 2 = fire, 3 = guard, 4 = nothing, 5 = lightning, etc). You also have mana which you can use to re-roll to gain a better score or combo, however the more you re-roll in that battle, the more mana it costs to re-roll the dice.

The equipment you get also has set bonuses so if you collect a staff, helm, and armor of the same set, you can get a bonus associated with the set (ie. Healing set, makes your healing spells stronger). The idea of the game is to collect stronger equipment and progress through the stages and defeat the boss of that stage. After a certain amount of stages are beaten, you move onto a new world.

## Final Thoughts
What I liked about this game is the simplicity of the game itself, its not heard to pick up on it at all and once you get the hang of the game, you can develop strategies to help you through the harder stages. For me I focused on a necromancer book, which gave me access to spells and life drain, as well as healing, and the complete healing set. Because of this combo, I was nearly invincible as I had the bonus healing set to heal me up if I took a massive blow and also the chance of rolling a heal spell was 33% OR landing on a life drain spell to hit my enemy and drain life with a 16% chance, so I had a 50% chance of healing either way and doing damage at the same time.

What I didn't like about the game is the lack of story and the linear gameplay. The progression of the game starts getting stale and once you have a special set and strategy set, the becomes easy and very repetitive.
