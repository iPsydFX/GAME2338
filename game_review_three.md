### Rating
4.5/5 Stars

## Summary
This game is about open racing. You assume the role of a driver, not named, assumed to be you. The game starts out with you purchasing your first car. Once you have bought one of the starter cars, you start out in an open city of San Diego where you can drive freely. The object of the game is to race other drivers, whether they be random racers, a series race, or championship. There are different types of cars (Tuners, Muscle, SUV, Luxury, Exotic, and Motorcycles) you can use and some races are only for those types of cars.

Once you win races, you start wining prize money which can be used to purchase upgrades to your car, whether cosmetic or performance. The cars are also ranked from D (lowest) to A (highest). The higher rank of your car, the faster and better it is. Also as you win races, you unlock extra options for performance tuning and cosmetic, such as body kits, and special skills depending on the type of car you're driving. The game also allows you free customization of your car, making it personable to you.

The controls are pretty simple and the game teaches you how to use any unlocked skills you aquire by giving you a cut scene where the mechanic of the game explains the ability and how to utilize it. As you win more races, you can then unlock other cities to visit and race. The races are labeled in color based on difficulty, green is easy, yellow is medium, and red is hard. The end game object is to earn rep in the cities and become the best racer.

## Final Thoughts
What I liked about this game is the control mechanics, if you're not a racer game person, this game makes it simple for teh novice player. The biggest thing I liked was the customization of your car and how you can tune it and make it look however you like it. I personally started with a VW GTI R32 and I love it, I have modded it to be lowered, have a nice looking body kit, and max tuned it for superior performance. The game is simple in which I can use that one starter car, even as a D rank, and win so many races no matter the difficulty. 

What I disliked about the game is open racing matches. Those types of matches are typically centered around racing to a spot on the map, because of that, you can end up taking long ways unless your familiar with the map or easily colliding into obstacles you can't see on the map, like cars or police barrades.

I'm not fond of racing games, in fact I down right hate them, but this game is the first racing game I have actually enjoyed playing for hours on end.
