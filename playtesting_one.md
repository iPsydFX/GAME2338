**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The game is a tap game, the game starts with a brief tutorial that teaches you about the game as well as the storyline and end goal. It will also give you notifications when you can achieve something by telling you where to click. For the age rating, a child will get the idea to tap, but may not know the entire mechnanics.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ I think with all mobile app games, that in-app purchases should be removed. It serves no purpose to the gameplay other than to give you a leg up in speeding through the game faster or getting items quicker. I prefer the work for it method, as you still reap the benefit of the game's items without spending actual money.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game is very balanced, as you progress through the game, the difficulty increases, however you have an option of restarting and getting gems to spend to increase your stats so you can progress further ito the game passed where you stopped. I feel this game is for intermediate players, as it contains the casual play aspect of being super easy and straiht forward. For those hardcore players, it brings a challenge to push to the highest limit you can before restarting. It will cause you to put in a lot of hours into the game

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The game timing is ok. There is a storyline you get as you reach certain levels in the game, however, there is no puase to the game, so the game is still running in the background, which can cause you to miss out on gifts or treasures. As I played the game, the storyline didn't pop-up too much, and most of the time its just random babbling.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes, the game theme and mechnanics fit really well into the game. The tap feature along with recruitment of monsters to auto attack give the tap game the same feeling as most tap games.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, I had a lot of fun playing the game and recommend it to any tap game player. I still to this day play the game and enjoy it. For me I feel it appeals to me mainly because of the theme and artwork. I find it addicting and strive to get as far as I can and then restarting to ge extra stat boosts.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I had no issues with the game at all. The developer have taken great care in making sure there are no bugs, at least none that I could find. The loading times were fast as you progress to new stages and the controls all worked well and did what they were supposed to do. The responsiveness of the controls was very good for the actions of the player. I feel that most tap games don't have the responsiveness that this game has as you can multi-touch to give you a faster tapping experience.
