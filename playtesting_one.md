**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Once you create your character and start the actual game, you are immediately given instructions on where to go to start your first mission. During the first mission, you are taken through a tutorial of the game mechanics and what controls do what. The rules were very understandable for the age range this game places. The storyline is progressional and understandable to what your main goal/objective is at that time.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The game was very thought out and I can't think of anything the game should remove. My only opinion is the home navigation. Instead of moving to a shop for example, you select the shop you want to go to from a menu, once in the shop you can move a cursor to interact with people or shopkeeper. I think this should've been removed and in its place an actual home base world you can move freely around.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game is very balanced, as you level up, you can play the same mission on a higher difficulty catering to those who are casual players and just want to play for fun and the hardcore players who want a challenge. Depending on what race/class you choose, the game makes a good balance of what that class/race has to offer. For example, an melee class will typically have higher health, attack, and defense and use melee weapons. Rangers on the other hand utilize guns and there is a meter that is used to represent your ammo, although it does refill albeit slowly, so it makes the game a bit harder. Forces (mages) are the hardest of classes to play as they are much weaker in terms of strength, life, defense, but excel in intellengence and spells, although those too will use up your Magic Meter. As far as races go, Androids will have the best stats in terms of strength, defense, and life, but have no magical ability. Humans are balanced in terms of stats and can use magic. Newmans are elvish creatures that excel in intellegence and magic, but low in terms of stats. So depending on your class/race, you can get the best of what your character can do or challenge yourself with the mix and match.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing in the game is pretty good. Depending on what you want to do in the game, the story line and cut scenes are not too long, not too short, to give a good flow of the game. The missions and action of the game is just right, not too long, but not too short. If you're the type who likes to level grind or wants action, you have the choice of playing the missions over again and getting straight into the action.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes, the game theme and mechnanics fit really well into the game. Taking place in a futuristic setting, the weapons, levels, and overall feel matched the theme perfectly.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, I had a lot of fun playing the game and recommend it to any action/rpg player. The game can get a bit repetitive with level grinding and the mission layouts are pretty much the same, there are typically 2 types of maps per mission and its random, however given time you know what to expect once you are in that mission.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I had no issues with the game at all. The developers have taken great care in making sure there are no bugs, at least none that I could find. The loading times were decent and the controls all worked well and did what they were supposed to do. The responsiveness of the controls was very good for the actions of the player.
